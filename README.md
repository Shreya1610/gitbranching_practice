Use this document as a starting point for Part 1 of the Class 6 exercise.

As part of this exercise you will create a series of 'trivia questions' and add them to this document. You will also provide an answer for each of the questions on a dedicated branch. Each branch must only contain the answer for the corresponding question (although it may also contain the other questions). See below for an example.

This question would appear on the master branch.

Q. What is the largest planet in the solar system?
The same question and the answer would appear on the dedicated 'answer branch'.

Q. What is the largest planet in the solar system?

Q What ia atoms ? 
A Every atom has a structure. By this, we mean that each atom has a central positively charged part. We call this the nucleus. The nucleus is made up of smaller positively charged particles or the protons. Outside the nucleus, even smaller negatively charged particles move about the nucleus. These particles are the electrons. The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is the atomic number of the atom. In an electrically neutral atom, the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons.
